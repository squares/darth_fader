USB-Powered, Configurable, Control Surface for Video Editing 

I've been doing a little bit of light video editing, and occasionally would look online to see if anyone had a control surface for sale. Unfortunately, they're all either too expensive or too poorly supported for me to make me feel like it would be a worthwhile investment. 

Instead, I decided to dig through my electronics parts bin, and see if I had what I'd need to make a passable controller.  This is the documentation for what I eventually ended up with, which I have to say I'm really very happy with.

As time goes on, I'll try to add more information here so that this is customizable for other purposes, but "out of the box", this is primarily targeted to working with Adobe Premiere.
